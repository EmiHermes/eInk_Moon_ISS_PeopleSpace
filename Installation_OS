The first step, as always, is to prepare your Raspberry PI with the latest OS.

- Download the latest OS (with desktop) from here: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/
- Write the image on an empty SD card.
- create an empty file "ssh" to enable the SSH connection.
- Save the "wpa_supplicant.conf" file on the SD card to have your Wifi configured to connect to your Raspberry PI via SSH (you have it prepared on your computer, I know it).

Start your Raspberry Pi.

Connect to it via SSH (you can also do it if you have a monitor, keyboard and mouse, but I don't have and I prefer to connect via SSH) and update it....

sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

Now, you have to enable VNC to be able to connect remotely and SPI for the e-Paper HAT:


sudo raspi-config

Interfacing Options > VNC > Yes
Interfacing Options > SPI > Yes

And reboot it.
