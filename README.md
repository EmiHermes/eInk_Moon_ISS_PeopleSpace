Raspberry eInk HAT to show the phase of the Monn, where is the ISS, How many people are in the space...


I had a Raspberry and a e-Paper HAT and I wanted to use it to show information like where is the ISS or how many people are now in the space...

I stated to look if there are APIs on the Internet to get those data, and I found them.
OK, gotcha !!!!

Wait, this HAT has 4 buttons, and then, I need 4 data to be shown...

- Where is now the ISS?
- How many people are now in the space?
- In which phase is the Moon?
- And what more?????

This project is to show data on a e-Paper screen, and the refresh is not every second, it could be every hour or every 5 minutes, depending on what you are showing.
For example, the phase of the Monn is not going to change until some hours, but tht ISS is moving and probably you want to show it every 5 minutes, but not every second.

This is a good project to be used with the eInk screen.
