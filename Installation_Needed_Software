Ok, now we have a running Raspberry PI with the latest software and all the basic to connect to it.

It's the moment to start installing the needed software to control the e-Paper HAT.

If you didn't plug the HAT on your Raspberry PI, now is the latest moment to connect it.
Switch off your Raspberry PI and put the HAT on it.

for the next steps you can follow the instructions from Waveshare or follow it with the next steps....
(https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.7inch_e-Paper_HAT)

Install BCM2835 libraries:

wget http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/bcm2835-1.60.tar.gz
tar zxvf bcm2835-1.60.tar.gz
cd bcm2835-1.60/
sudo ./configure
sudo make
sudo make check
sudo make install
#For more details, please refer to http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/


Install wiringPi libraries:

sudo apt-get install wiringpi
#For Pi 4, you need to update itï¼š
cd /tmp wget https://project-downloads.drogon.net/wiringpi-latest.deb
sudo dpkg -i wiringpi-latest.deb gpio -v
#You will get 2.52 information if you install it correctly

Install Python libraries:
(If you updated the SO with the latest version, all of these steps will be like "Requirement already satisfied").

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo apt-get install python3-pil
sudo apt-get install python3-numpy
sudo pip3 install RPi.GPIO
sudo pip3 install spidev


Now you can download the examples from Waveshare:

sudo git clone https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper
cd e-Paper/RaspberryPi\&JetsonNano/

I recommend you to remove some folders:
- e-Paper/Arduino (It's a Raspberry PI).
- e-Paper/STM32 (It's a Raspberry PI).
- e-Paper/Raspberry & JetsonNano/c (we'll use python on this project).
- e-Paper/Raspberry & JetsonNano/python/examples (you don't need them if all works).

you will not use them, and you don't need them on a Raspberry PI.

I recommend you to move the "lib" folder a bit back to use it easily:

sudo mv lib /home/pi/e-Paper/

And, if you wish, you can remove all the files that you don't need from the "lib" folder, like:
- epd1in02.py
- epd1in54.py
- epd2in9.py
- ...

If we are going to use a 2.5inch, the rest of the files are NOT needed.


All the needed software is installed.

The next step is our code!
